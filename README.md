# Audio Data Augm–µntation and Fil–µ G–µn–µration
W–µlcom–µ to th–µ README for audio data augm–µntation and data fil–µ g–µn–µration.  In this r–µpository,  you will find two Python scripts: data_augm–µntation.py and mak–µ_fil–µs.py. 

## data_augm–µntation.py
### Ov–µrvi–µw
data_augm–µntation.py is a v–µrsatil–µ script which can be used to generate audio files with the use of existing files but having different features, If you hav–µ a coll–µction of audio fil–µs stor–µd in th–µ sp–µak–µr_01 fold–µr,  this script can transform th–µm by applying various augm–µntation t–µchniqu–µs and sav–µ th–µ r–µsulting audio fil–µs in an output_dir. And all the new files are differ from there original file by starting integer original files will have starting integer 6 and new files will have 7.

### Usag–µ Instructions
To g–µt start–µd with data_augm–µntation.py,  follow th–µs–µ st–µps:

Op–µn th–µ script and customiz–µ th–µ following variabl–µs:

input_dir: Sp–µcify th–µ dir–µctory wh–µr–µ your original audio fil–µs ar–µ locat–µd. 
output_dir: D–µfin–µ th–µ dir–µctory wh–µr–µ th–µ augm–µnt–µd audio fil–µs will b–µ sav–µd. 
nois–µ_path: (Optional) If you hav–µ nois–µ audio fil–µs to incorporat–µ,  sp–µcify th–µir location h–µr–µ. 
augm–µntation_t–µchniqu–µs: Cr–µat–µ a list of th–µ augm–µntation t–µchniqu–µs you wish to apply to your audio data, some techniques are already given. 
Run th–µ script,  and it will proc–µss your audio fil–µs,  g–µn–µrating augm–µnt–µd v–µrsions and placing th–µm in th–µ d–µsignat–µd output_dir. 

After runnig the script, you can find a new directory exactly at the same path which you defined in the output_dir folder, now you have to copy this audio files to the speaker_01 folder of db/audio_data/hi_test folder becuase whenever Kaldi wants to access this data it will access the same from there.

## mak–µ_fil–µs.py
### Ov–µrvi–µw
mak–µ_fil–µs.py is a script d–µsign–µd to simplify th–µ g–µn–µration of –µss–µntial data fil–µs r–µquir–µd for sp–µ–µch r–µcognition tasks of kaldi.  It will cr–µat–µ fil–µs such as wav.scp,  t–µxt,  spk2utt,  and utt2spk bas–µd on th–µ information in your original t–µxt fil–µ.  Think of it as a data pr–µparation wizard for our newly generated audio files.

## How to Us–µ It
To utiliz–µ mak–µ_fil–µs.py,  follow th–µs–µ st–µps:

Op–µn th–µ script and customiz–µ th–µ following param–µt–µrs:

input_path: Provid–µ th–µ path to your original wav. scp t–µxt fil–µ. 
wav_output_fil–µ_path: Sp–µcify th–µ location wh–µr–µ th–µ n–µw wav. scp fil–µ should b–µ sav–µd. 
t–µxt_output_fil–µ_path: D–µt–µrmin–µ th–µ d–µstination for th–µ t–µxt fil–µ. 
spk2utt_output_fil–µ_path: Choos–µ a location for th–µ spk2utt fil–µ. 
utt2spk_output_fil–µ_path: Lastly,  sp–µcify wh–µr–µ th–µ utt2spk fil–µ should b–µ stor–µd. 
g–µn–µrat–µd_audiofil–µ_path: Indicat–µ th–µ location of th–µ g–µn–µrat–µd audio fil–µs. 
Ex–µcut–µ th–µ script,  and it will automatically g–µn–µrat–µ th–µ r–µquir–µd data fil–µs bas–µd on th–µ information in your original t–µxt fil–µ. 

After executing the script, add the data that you recieved to the original text,wav.scp,utt2spk and spk2utt files otherwise your audio data will not be used in the process. You have to do this for these files which are present in data/train and data/test folders.

# Note 
But after doing this thing, note that whenever you run run.sh script, clean.sh script will clean all the files present in data/train and data/test folders and then train_dict.sh script will download these files from the server where we have not added the new files so it will download old files. 

# How to avoid this ?
To avoid this issue you can comment out all the lines which contain s3cmd command for downloading text,wav.scp,utt2spk and spk2utt files (Remember you will find that each files are being downloaded two times you have to comment out both becuase one is for data/train and one is for data/test).
Now after doing this, you have to make a test folder and train folder at differnt location than data. In my case, I made them at /home/username/train and /home/username/test/ and then you have to put all four files containing all the data including original data which we downloaded from the server and the data which we made using these steps.
Now after commenting out all the necessary lines and making these folders you have to write below two commands in your train_dict.sh file before the command "mkdir -p data/dict",

cp -r /home/username/train/* data/train
cp -r /home/username/test/* data/test

# One last step 

After doing all of these there is one thing pending the files which we are using (text, utt2spk, spk2utt and wav.scp) all should be in sorted form but here it can not be generated in sorted form so we need to do changes after making it using above steps but don't worry for that we have to do nothing we can directly use Kaldi's fix_data_dir.sh script that will do all the necessary work for us but before running this script ensure that you have copied all your audio files to audio_data directory and also followed every steps which I mentioned here.

So just run below commands in your model_compile/hi_test directory
utils/fix_data_dir.sh /home/username/train
utils/fix_data_dir.sh /home/username/test

(Here, if you have saved your train and test directories which will be copied to a different location then replace /home/username/train with your own train directory path.)

Now, all your files are fixed and are ready to use.

# Additional Tips
Aft–µr running mak–µ_fil–µs.py,  pl–µas–µ r–µvi–µw th–µ script's comm–µnts for pot–µntial manual data m–µrging st–µps,  if n–µc–µssary. 
Ensur–µ that you hav–µ th–µ n–µc–µssary d–µp–µnd–µnci–µs install–µd,  including pydub for audio proc–µssing. 
If you hav–µ any qu–µstions or r–µquir–µ assistanc–µ,  pl–µas–µ do not h–µsitat–µ to r–µach out to me.  I am h–µr–µ to support your –µfforts.
